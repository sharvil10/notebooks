Workbench images are supported for a minimum of one year. Major updates to pre-configured notebook images occur approximately every six months. Therefore, two supported notebook images are typically available at any given time. If necessary, you can still access older notebook images from the registry, even if they are no longer supported. You can then add the older notebook images as custom notebook images to cater to the projectâ€™s specific requirements.

Open Data Hub contains the following workbench images with different variations:

These notebooks are incorporated to be used in conjunction with Open Data Hub, specifically utilizing the ODH Notebook Controller as the launching platform. The table above provides insights into the characteristics of each notebook, including their availability in both ODH and OpenShift AI environments, GPU support, and whether they are offered as runtimes ie without the JupyterLab UI.  

All the notebooks are available on the[ Quay.io registry](https://quay.io/repository/opendatahub/workbench-images?tab=tags&tag=latest); please filter the results by using the tag "2023b" for the latest release and "2023a" for the n-1.

## Jupyter Data Science

Standard Data Science provides a browser-based integrated development environment where you can write, edit, and debug code using the familiar interface and features of JupyterLab. Use the Standard Data Science notebook image for models that do not require TensorFlow or PyTorch.  
This image contains commonly used libraries to assist you in developing your machine-learning models. Furthermore, we have integrated several useful libraries and applications. Notably, we've included **Mesa-libgl**, an additional library designed for OpenCV tasks. We've also introduced **Git-lfs**, which provides an efficient solution for handling large files, such as audio samples, videos, datasets, and graphics. The integration of **unixODBC** offers a standardized API for accessing data sources, including SQL Servers and other data sources with ODBC drivers. Lastly, the addition of **Libsndfile** makes it easier to read and write files containing sampled audio data. Additionally, this notebook comes equipped with standard **database clients** for MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, and MongoDB.

**NOTE:** All notebooks derived from the Jupyter Data Science Notebook inherit these libraries and applications, with the exception of the minimal and CUDA variants.
